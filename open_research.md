I believe that trust, transparency, and collaboration is how we best support collective scientific advance. In the hopes that others sharing our goals and interests will adopt inactive ideas or pilots, we make all stages of our research available in a way that makes this possible. To avoid wasting the best years of young researchers on duplicate research, we hope you will let us know you intend to do so.

We automate computational workflows from raw data to finished reports using the lightweight [GWF](https://gwf.org) tool to ensure our work is reproducible in practice and not just in principle. Using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), we automate the continuous publishing of project documentation using GitHub actions on the [munch-group GitHub account](https://github.com/munch-group). Each idea or project is listed below as either Inactive, Active, or Completed.

Cheers Kasper
