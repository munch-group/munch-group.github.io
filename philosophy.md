## Group research culture

I value trust, freedom, creativity, and a healthy work-life relationship. I value qualitative rather than quantitative advances. I support intellectual courage and open-mindedness to ideas and hypotheses outside the norm. I strive to be a PI in the mold of Auguste Gusteau.

## Reproducible research

We conduct our work to be reproducible in practice, not just in principle. We achieve this by automating the workflow from raw data to a finished manuscript using [GWF](https://gwf.org), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
