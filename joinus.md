## Open positions

I am seeking a talented graduate student to do a PhD in my research group on the population genomics of intra-genomic conflict in primates. Specifically, how sex-chromosome meiotic drive generates reproductive barriers through infertility of male hybrids. The application deadline is May 1. and the student would begin Aug. 1. The student would join several others at BiRC working with similar questions, and the salary is quite generous. [Email me](mailto:kaspermunch@birc.au.dk) to hear more if you are interested.

## Postdoc collaborations

The Danish and European funding systems provide postdoc funding for foreign early-career researchers. If you share our research interests, I am always happy to help develop a postdoc application to join the group. Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:kaspermunch@birc.au.dk).
