    "text": "DXZ4\nIn humans, the long noncoding RNAs, DANT1 and DANT, are expressed from DXZ4 on the inactive chrX (Xi), promoting superlooping (Figueroa et al. 2015). They also facilitate the localization of the Barr body to the nucleolar membrane in mammals (Dossin & Heard 2022).\nDXZ4 is a major-effect hybrid male sterility locus in the Felis genus (Bredemeyer et al. 2021). Germ cells of sterile male hybrids show RA-specific methylation defects and DANT1 misregulation, resulting in failed MSCI and meiotic arrest, a phenotype also seen in mice hybrids (Larson et al. 2016). In cats, the DXZ4 macrosatelite has a RA and RB array (human is RA), each with repeats binding CTCF, and here, the RA is in the top 0.5% of the most rapidly evolving 5-kb windows across cats (Bredemeyer et al. 2023). Ablation (“tissue-specific knockout”) of DXZ4 does not change the silenced state of the inactive chrX in mice and humans (Bonora et al. 2018; Froberg et al. 2018). However, its conservation suggests that DXZ4 is important to XCI and maybe MSCI.\nAnalyzing borders of existing assemblies (Bredemeyer et al. 2023) finds DXZ4 across mammals with species having either the RA or RB array with relatively constrained repeat sizes (between 3 and 4.9 kb). Strangely, Bovids have lost DXZ4.",

The programme supports projects where 2-4 research groups collaborate (a main applicant plus 1-3 co-applicants).\n\n\nThe programme supports exploration of un-tested, high-risk/high-gain ideas. The project period will support establishing pilot data providing basis for continuing into a more complex and expanded project stage. If there at the application stage already exists pilot data, the applicants are encouraged to consider the Interdisciplinary Synergy Programme.\n\n\nGoogle Doc:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1T05GhVqA6EJ7k_YscqI3PEdXCUpoi0yg5p5wqDrQwUU/edit",

    "text": "Lewontin’s paradox\n\nNeutral theory predicts that genetic diversity increases with population size, yet\n\nobserved levels of diversity across metazoans vary only two orders of magnitude while population sizes vary over several. This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is known as Lewontin’s Paradox of Variation (1974). Quantifying the relationship between genetic diversity and population size suggests natural selection cannot explain Lewontin’s Paradox https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67509\n\nDoes reproductive variance (in fertility/even meiosis) correlate with census size? A larger N means more frequent introduction of new (potentially selected) variants. If larger N means more stable alleles which again allow alleles to be more extreme drivers while still be averagely even in meiosis… Then each the variance across idividual X/Y pairs would be higher. See if Lewinton’s paradox applies to species without x chromosomes… See if the variance in the allele drive values is larger for higher N. Remember to extract only odd rows and even columns. Distortion does not in it self does not produce a fitness reduction by more than 0.5. It will have to include an decrease in fertility too. If there are a very large number of alleles, then there cannot emerge a X new allele that is equally fertile with all the Y chromosomes. It can only be averagely\n\n        Page 4 of 15  \n\nIdeas / notes - Sunday, 2 June 2024 at 15.21\n\nmore fertile by fitting with as many as possible.\n\nThe dynamic balance of antagonizing drivers of X and Y is affected by census size and/or exponential population growth in a way that induces a larger genetic load on X and Y in populations with very large census sizes\n\nCan reversed sweeps explain even Ne across species?\n\nCan the same rate of environment change across species homogenize Ne if we assume positive selection is mutation limited and thus proportional to census size?\n\nDo species with larger Ne tend to have smaller X/A?\n\nIf we know DFEs and Mb-scale recombination rate is shared among closely related species, then 1Mb windows should be comparable between species, because each window average over the differences and adjacent windows have similar mean rates in the two species.\n\nRolling regression using pymc? - comparing pi of two closely related species with different Ne along the genome\n\nInterferrence score?\n\nFit a combination of interferrence_maps across different scales to diversity data. If high Nc species do not have as high Ne as expected, what scale of linker selection explains this. Near or far?\n\nRun Yuns model on the primates to get constrained sites\n\nMake rolling regression of pi explained by pi of other species and rec rate With many genomes from two closely related species, would it make sense to look at relate trees rather than diversity?\n\nCould my run statistic quantify selection on quantitative traits across species with different Ne?\n\nDo ILS smiley plot as rolling regression\n\nAsk Thomas about Guy Sella shift phase and Lewintons paradox\n\nCan my run stat quantify selection on quantitative traits by rapid changes to allele frequencies a la Guy Sella\n\nIf we assume that functional sites and recombination rate is the same in band- tailed and passenger pigeons, then we can subtract the pi on the two in each window to get effect of only population size.

An important aspect that has come out in the last decade is that the intermediate alleles are also associated with a phenotype called FAXTAS (Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome) and in females is also associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Because the intermediate alleles in oocytes are deleterious (premature ovarian failure), the full mutations are selected for in the female germline – which explained the maternal transmission of full alleles and genetic anticipation.\nOn the male side, things are different, and variation occurs in the normal to grey/intermediate zone only (PMCID: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1914886/ ) – but interestingly, grey/intermediate fathers never transmit full mutations to their daughters – moreover, in the sperm of Frax male with full mutations (in blood), the allele is always retracted in sperm and testes – suggesting that there is a negative selection on full mutations in the male germline (doi: 10.1038/ng0693-143).\nThis article indirectly suggests that selection may be taking place in culture ·· DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/jmg.37.11.842\nThere are lots of old papers that look at the distribution of alleles in the population. The striking thing to me is how polymorphic this site is and how common the ‘grey zone’ alleles are – I think it is estimated that the prevalence of ’expanded grey zone (40-54CGG) is 1:18 females and 1:32 males.\nMacro-orchidism is a diagnostic criterion of FraX in males – this is also observed in mouse model. The old descriptions are probably the most comprehensive -you can start with this maybe? · DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00284911\nHope this helps to get you started and this is what you were after? - it sounds complicated but it is worth trying to pick things apart.\nLet me know if you want to discuss further ?\nNotes\nThere are almost no pachytene peak genes on X.

    "section": "Evolutionary strata on X",
    "text": "Evolutionary strata on X\nAs we discussed, it is pretty amazing that the even X/Y transmission in spermatogenesis works at all if all an X (or Y) gene, essential to late spermatids/spermatozoa, needs to do is delay its expression until it can no longer be shared with cells with the Y (or X), instead of expressing early and handing it to the Y (or X) it through the chromatoid body. It must have taken a lot of selection to ensure this did not happen, as additional X and Y chromosome chunks stopped recombining. Maybe by moving offending genes to the autosomes, by adding compensating gametologs to the other sex chromosome (like VCY copied from VCX in the human-chimp ancestor), or by moving control of X and Y genes the autosomes (like PRDM9 seems to affect VCX transcription). On the other hand, the sex chromosomes will have opposed these processes, E.g., by duplicating genes (like SLY/SLX in mice). As you said, it may be possible to see these processes play out by looking at the expression of genes lost and duplicated and whether the time of loss/gain of genes relevant to spermatogenesis correlates with the time of the different strata on X.\nWhy are there so few syntenic changes on X? A new segregating Y inversion will can be targetet by X drivers. So inversions only happen if the Y inversion can itself drive. Same would go for X inversions I guess…\nMaybe drivers are what keeps the PARs from shrinking. The latest one could be SHROOM2",

In an early meeting more than 250,000 years ago, the Neanderthal Y chromosome was replaced by the modern human version (Petr et al. n.d.), and the X chromosome introgressed at least as much as the autosomes (Hubisz et al. 2020). In the later meeting around 55,000 years ago, the direction of admixture was reversed. Here the Neanderthal Y chromosome did not introgress into the out-of-Africa anatomically modern humans and the X chromosome introgressed to a much smaller extent (0.3%) than the autosomes (1.4) (Sankararaman et al. 2016). Large regions of the X chromosome today are devoid of Neanderthal introgression - coined as Neanderthal deserts - and overlap with the regions of the X chromosome repeatedly targeted by natural selection in great apes, as discussed above.",

How many othe genes need to be with same ancestry as the gene itself? One? Two? Ect. This “degree” should influence the dependency on minor parent ancestry: The more genes a gene depends on, the more with the minor ancestry proportion matter. Extreme cases: no minor ancestry proportion is small enough if a gene depends on all other genes.

Longer segments have had not had a long time to be purged by selection and may not be informative of selection (on the other hand they likely have more deleterious mutations because of their length). What happens to the introgression landscape if we stratify by segment length.\n\nPurging speed (strength of negative selection) as a function of minor parent ancestry proportion (MPAP): Can we measure that empirically and compare to a theoretical prediction parameterized by amount of epistatic interaction?

    "text": "Feasibility, postdoc training, schedule and publication plan\n\nState of the art\nIn all but a very few cases, we do not know which genes that are responsible for the reduced fertility of hybrids that eventually lead to formation of new species. We do know, however, that when incompatibility does arise, it almost always first appears as reduced fertility of the heterogametic sex (E. g XY mammal males or ZW female birds). This phenomenon has been dubbed Haldane’s rule and represents a century of empirical observations. In the past few years, genomic analyses of individual species groups have confirmed that portions of X and Z chromosomes resist genetic exchange among closely related species. Still, the responsible genes remain unknown, and the evolutionary mechanisms by which incompatibilities arise remain poorly understood. The Dobzhansky-Muller model proposes that incompatibility arises when sets of coevolving inter-dependent genes in each population diverge to a point where combinations of genes from different populations no longer function.\nI and others have proposed that a rapid buildup of incompatibilities between sex chromosomes is fueled by an arms race between competing selfish genes on each chromosome (Figure 1A). Only small parts of the sex chromosomes recombine in meiosis. A consequence of this is that genes on sex chromosomes can promote their own transmission to the next generation. E.g. an X-linked gene can control its own selection by any means that leave more viable sperm cells carrying X chromosomes than carrying Y chromosomes. It can do so either by influencing the symmetry of meiosis or by killing sperm cells that carry the Y chromosome (Meiklejohn and Tao 2010). Such meiotic drive will promote the selfish gene variants, even if these are harmful to the organism’s fitness and distort the sex-ratio of offspring. Sex chromosome meiotic drive has been observed in several species (Jaenike 1999), and its genetic basis has recently been proposed in both fruit files (Bachtrog, Ellison et al. 2018) and mice (Rathje, Johnson et al. 2019). In these cases, the responsible genes are ampliconic, and such genes are also found in primates. However, any sex-linked critical gene expressed during or after meiosis has the potential to act as a meiotic driver. I have previously shown that, unlike the remaining genome, the X chromosome was targeted by strong recurrent selection across great ape evolution (Nam, Munch et al. 2015, Munch, Nam et al. 2016). Most recently, I reported that the X chromosomes of non-African humans were hit by bursts of very strong selection between 45 and 55 thousand years ago (Skov, Macia et al. 2018). Together, these observations strongly support the action of meiotic drive.\nAn arms-race between meiotic drivers on X and Y (or Z and W) will accelerate the coevolution of these genes. This will lead to faster divergence of sex chromosomes between populations and eventually induce reproductive incompatibilities between X and Y chromosomes from different populations (Figure 1). This arms-race has been observed in mice (Rathje, Johnson et al. 2019) and has the potential to explain the widely observed infertility of hybrid XY males and ZW females (Coyne and Orr 2004). It may also explain the observation that genes on the X chromosome contribute disproportionately to sterility (Masly and Presgraves 2007).\nI propose that meiotic balance is maintained by antagonizing meiotic drivers on separate sex chromosomes that depress and stabilize each other’s frequency. Perturbations of this equilibrium will trigger strong temporary selection on individual meiotic drivers. In ongoing work, I use forward simulations to show that competing meiotic drivers can be kept at low frequency by frequency-dependent selection and that the resulting dynamic equilibrium maintains meiotic balance (Figure 2). I also find that admixture or demographic perturbations disturb this equilibrium, triggering strong temporary selection on individual driver variants. The hypothesis can thus explain my observations of strong selection on the X chromosome coinciding with the exodus of modern humans from Africa (Skov, Macià et al. 2018). The hypothesis also reconciles strong selection on individual meiotic drivers with empirical observations of stable and even sex ratios in most species.\nBecause meiotic drive reduces fertility and distorts the sex-ratio, I propose that these detrimental effects trigger compensating adaptive selection on normal genes across the genome to restore fertility and an even sex ratio. Such compensation may explain why genes in tumor suppression pathways are among the most rapidly adapting genes in the genome (Nielsen, Bustamante et al. 2005). This adaptation is unexpected because these genes perform cellular tasks that serve core cellular functions, which are not expected to require much if any, adaptive evolution. Such genes are found in the TP53 signaling pathway that controls DNA damage response and apoptosis. This regulatory network strongly overlaps networks of genes controlling recombination and meiosis. Many of these genes are located on the X chromosome, and my recent report (Skov, Macià et al. 2018) suggests that several of them may be meiotic drivers (E.g., HUWE1, and SMC1A). I hypothesize that the selection of such X-linked drivers may perturb the overlapping networks to induce apoptosis of Y carrying sperm, thus producing a preferential transmission of X carrying sperm. This detrimental effect on male fertility is then expected to trigger compensating adaptive evolution of other genes in the same networks to counter this regulatory perturbation and restore male fertility and an even sex ratio of children. In a pilot study addressing this hypothesis, I found that the 3p21.3 genomic region has been affected by recurrent adaptation, and it indeed harbors an abundance of genes in the TP53 network: IP6K2, USP4, HYAL2, HYAL3, and PRKAR2A.\nI thus present a general model of the genetic basis of speciation and its derived effects across the genome. The model not only explains existing empirical evidence but also has the potential to guide new insights into speciation and fertility.\n\n\nObjectives and scientific impact\nAlthough the genetic basis of hybrid incompatibility will vary across species groups, each one is an individual outcome of a similar evolutionary process. By accumulating evidence across species groups, I will thus be able to learn which classes of genes and regulatory networks that are responsible, and to identify general mechanisms by which mutation, selection, and recombination contribute to the accumulation of incompatibility. I will also be able to detect differences across groups of species, attributed to the sex-determination system (XY vs. ZW), population size, dispersal range, and sperm competition. In each species, I will identify candidate meiotic drivers by locating strong selection on X and Z chromosomes. I will link each candidate driver gene to hybrid incompatibility by testing if their exchange between species is associated with reduced fitness.\nThis project is the first to link natural selection in the form of meiotic drive to hybrid incompatibility across many groups of species. By answering fundamental evolutionary questions, the results from this project will impact many connected research fields. Being able to evaluate from genomic data alone, which populations are emerging new species, will inform biodiversity management. Understanding how tumor-suppression adapt to counter regulatory disruptions by meiotic drivers will provide new insights into the regulatory dependencies of tumor-suppressors. New insights into the sensitivities of male fertility will identify new genes and pathways as potential targets for explaining and treating the subfertility of one-third of Danish men.\n\n\nData\nTo maximize inference power, I will analyze all available full genome data sets from species groups with different characteristics, such as XY or ZW karyotype (E. g. birds or bats), dispersal range (E. g. birds vs monkeys), population size (E. g. mosquitos vs polar bears), and divergence time (E. g. ape species vs ape populations). Analysis workflows will be designed to allow the seamless addition of the many additional genomic data sets that will become available during the project period. I now have access to the following full genome data, either through public access, or early access through collaborations with (Guojie Zhang DK, Jeffrey Rodgers, US, and Tomas Marques-Bonet, Spain): &gt;1000 humans across 51 populations, 43 Gorillas across three subspecies, 26 orangutans across two species, 58 chimpanzees across four subspecies, 13 bonobos, 105 baboons across five subspecies, 163 vervet monkeys across five populations, 89 bears across two species, 60 bats across three species, 56 finches across four species, 60 penguins across three species, 690 swordtail fish across four species, 1142 mosquitos across two species and six populations. With a few exceptions, each data set includes both pure unadmixed and hybrid populations/species. In addition, I have access to a single genome of a large number of species: 55 primates, 344 birds, 854 butterflies, and 81 flatworms and roundworms. Where genome samples from admixture zones are not available, I will acquire such samples through collaborations and perform supplementary genome sequencing myself. The project budget covers sequencing of 300 such samples.\n\n\nAutomation of reproducible HPC workflows\nGoal: establish automated HPC workflows. The key to the success of this project is the scale of parallel analyzes so that each of the computationally demanding analyses described below can be applied to any number of large data sets on our HPC facility (GenomeDK). This requires a high level of automation that I will achieve by embedding all analyses in one pipeline. To this end, I will use a workflow library (GWF) that we have developed at the Bioinformatics Research Centre (BiRC). This tool graphs dependencies between analyses to maintain the integrity of the pipeline as analyses update and data sets are added. All steps from the initial curation of raw data to the final summary analyses as Jupyter notebooks will be embedded in this workflow. I will use Conda (by Anaconda) to maintain reproducible library dependencies, and all developed analyses will be distributed as self-contained Conda packages or Docker images. This allows collaborating research groups, with access to proprietary or sensitive data, to run the analyses in-house and only contribute anonymized meta-data to this project.\n\n\nMeiotic drivers in living species\nGoal: develop tailored methods for inference of sweeps. Recent adaptive evolution manifests as selective sweeps of genetic variation. However, meiotic drive may not be recent and is expected to produce incomplete sweeps, which leave a similar, but more subtle, genetic signature. I will develop new specialized methods able to identify this particular signal.\nI will develop a suite of population genetic summary statistics, each tailored to the particular inference of candidate regions subject to non-recent incomplete sweeps. This will be done in collaboration with David Enard (University of Arizona), who has already developed one such statistic, hapDAF, which quantifies linkage of high-frequency variants. This statistic has very good power to detect simulated non-recent partial sweeps. Tailored summary statistics will initially be combined into a composite score using a framework following (Grossman, Shlyakhter et al. 2010). I will then develop a more powerful approach by training deep convolutional neural networks on vectors of summary statistics to classify each genomic region as subjected to a sweep or not.\nFor a detailed analysis of causal variants in swept regions, I will develop a tailored method, which extends a recently published model (Stern, Wilton et al. 2019). This method integrates over marginal genealogies at a focal site to test if inferred frequency trajectories of candidate alleles are unlikely without selection. I will modify the likelihood model to describe a confined non-recent episode of strong selection. By incorporating demography in the null model, this approach is also able to distinguish the similar effects of population bottlenecks and selective sweeps. In addition to allowing a more powerful estimation of selection strength, this method will allow me to test my hypothesis that strong selection on meiotic drivers is episodic and does not lead to the fixation of drivers. This test is possible because the developed approach will enable me to estimate the historical allele frequency of meiotic drivers.\nI will apply both methods to all population genomic diversity data for all available species and populations to identify candidate meiotic drivers on the X and Z sex chromosomes. To address the hypothesis that demographic events may trigger strong temporary selection on drivers, I will estimate the historical population size of each species, using HMM-based methods (SMC++, and MSMC). I will then relate the strength and number of identified sweeps to the occurrence of a demographic event such as population bottlenecks.\n\n\nMeiotic drivers in ancestral species\nGoal: find sweeps in ancestral species. Whereas patterns of genetic diversity reveal the recent action of selection, I need to analyze genomic patterns of divergence between multiple species to reveal the effect of the selection across long evolutionary time scales. The common ancestor of two sequences sampled from different species is much older than the time they stopped interbreeding. If the population size of the ancestral species is large, the common sequence ancestor may reach all the way back into an additional species shared by a third species. In this case, the topology of individual gene trees may differ from the topology of the species tree. This is a phenomenon called incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which I have worked on for many years (Figure 3).\nFor all relevant trios of closely related species, I will use a coalescent hidden Markov model (Dutheil, et al. 2009), to infer the gene tree topology for each consecutive segment of the aligned genomes using both Viterbi and posterior decoding of each trained HMM. The vast amount of data produced will be stored efficiently as tree-sequence data structures using tsKit. Strong selective sweeps, produced by meiotic drivers in ancestral species, will induce immediate ancestry of lineages. Completed hard selective sweeps are thus readily detectable as wide genomic regions without any ILS (Figure 3C). Soft or partial sweeps are visible as wide genomic regions with a homogeneously reduced, but non-zero, proportion of ILS. I can thus test my hypothesis that meiotic drivers sweep when the equilibrium of antagonizing meiotic drivers is disturbed. In this case, soft sweeps (selection on pre-existing variants) and non-recent partial (aborted) sweeps should be much more prevalent on the X and Z chromosomes than on the remaining genome. I will evaluate the significance of each low-ILS region by comparing its size, distribution of segment lengths, and autocorrelation of ILS proportion, to empirical background distributions obtained from the entire genome (accounting for the difference in effective population sizes of sex chromosomes and autosomes).\nI will identify sweeps on all chromosomes of each entire ancestral genome. However, in line with my previous work (Dutheil, Munch et al. 2015, Nam, Munch et al. 2015, Munch, Nam et al. 2016), I expect to find most of them on the X and Z chromosomes. Indeed, in a preliminary unpublished analysis of ILS on the X chromosome of the human-chimpanzee and human-orangutan ancestors I find several strong sweeps in these ancestors. I will detect individual sweeps in all ancestral species, but also combine gene tree information for all species trios, to produce gene trees spanning the entire 55 primates, 344 birds, 854 butterflies, and 81 worms. This way I will combine evidence of selection across ancestral species.\n\n\nThe time scale of reproductive isolation\nGoal: learn when admixture occurred between diverging populations. I will develop and apply a new method to infer historical admixture between species and populations. Knowledge of such admixture is required to test if admixture ceases for sex-chromosomes before it does for the remaining genome. It is also necessary to test the hypothesis that events of secondary contact between diverging population trigger strong meiotic drive, as suggested by my recent report on the human expansion from Africa (Skov, Macià et al. 2018).\nRecent admixture between species or populations will be inferred using published software (see below) and dated from the length distribution of genomic admixture segments. State of the art for estimating older admixture exploits the covariance structure of genetic diversity between populations. These methods, however, perform a greedy search for an admixture graph with a good fit to data and do not provide an estimate of confidence in the obtained result. I propose a new approach to inference that does not have these shortcomings. Recent work has shown that the coalescent, which models the ancestry of sampled genes, can elegantly be described using phase-type distributions (Hobolth, Siri-Jegousse et al. 2019). In this new formulation, it is possible to obtain the full (multivariate) distribution of the frequency spectrum of variants (site frequency spectrum) in a single population. Together with a MSc student, I have shown that the phase-type formulation maps directly to directed acyclic graphs for the relevant models. This insight dramatically reduces the running time, allowing for up to 50 samples and thus powerful inference. Using this approach, I have also shown a general expression for the joint distribution of branch lengths of gene tree lineages with different numbers of descendants. Preliminary results show that I will be able to compute the joint likelihood of the site frequency spectra from two populations with common ancestry. I will extend this simple setting to three populations with the possibility of admixture between species. Because we can compute the likelihood of an observed multi-population SFS given a species-admixture graph, we can use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain posterior probabilities of such graphs as well as the marginal probabilities of individual admixture events. Having obtained an admixture graph, I will estimate the dates of species splits and admixture events using a coalescent HMM.\n\n\nThe genomic location of reproductive barriers\nGoal: learn if candidate meiotic drivers are the first genes that induce hybrid incompatibility.\nHaving identified candidate meiotic drivers, I will investigate if their rapid evolution induces a lower fitness of hybrids. In this case, the candidate genes will resist admixture and produce genomic regions around them that are free from genomic segments introduced from other populations or subspecies – so-called “admixture deserts”. There is ample empirical evidence that both X and Z chromosomes harbor an abundance of such wide regions. However, the regions contain a large number of potentially responsible genes. Because the size of the admixture desert on each side of a causal gene is the outcome of a stochastic process, I will be able to sharply reduce the number of gene candidates by limiting the search to admixture deserts shared by many related species. Prediction of admixed segments along the genome will be made using published methods. To detect recent admixture between sampled populations, I will use the HMM-based ChromoPainter and HMM+MCMC based RELATE and ARGweaver-D to identify admixed genomic segments. To detect admixture segments contributed from unsampled populations, I will use a method using conditional random fields. I will also use the HMM-based method, which I used to detect archaic introgression into modern humans in my recent report of strong selection on the human X chromosome.\n\n\nInvasion of meiotic drivers\nGoal: identify meiotic drivers that invaded other populations. Perhaps counterintuitively, the meiotic drivers, which fuel accelerated coevolution of sex-linked genes and the buildup of incompatibility between populations, can themselves invade other subspecies (Meiklejohn, Landeen et al. 2018). This will happen if they are able to act as meiotic drivers in the recipient subspecies. Such introgressions constitute a separate type of observations, which can be used to identify meiotic drivers. To infer such introgressions, I will develop a new approach based on a newly published study (VolcanoFinder), which models a characteristic but weak signature in genetic diversity. In the particular case of non-African humans, the statistical power can be increased ten-fold by analyzing only genetic variation unique to non-Africans. In the many other species, the same trick can be used for a similar performance boost. I will also develop an approach based on called genomic admixture segments that quantify if the sharing of segments is more prevalent than expected from population structure. These methods will be applied to all available admixing species. Historical invasions between ancestral species will be identified from ILS patterns as extended regions showing a gene tree different from the species tree. Here, I will call individual ancestral invasions, but also to identify the accumulated signal of repeated invasions of a gene across a species tree from a significantly elevated amount of ILS.\n\n\nCompensating autosomal adaptation\nGoal: learn how sex-linked drive affects adaptation across the genome. Many of the most rapidly adapting genes in the genome are part of sizeable regulatory gene networks linked to tumor suppression. I will expand the inference of selective sweeps in each species to include the entire genome. This will allow me to investigate if the adapting genes are in the same pathways as meiotic drivers and thus build support for my hypothesis that meiotic drive triggers compensating adaptation of these autosomal genes. This will be done using published software for signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA).\nIn a complementary approach, I will test if the same is true for adaptive evolution over long evolutionary time scales. I will compare genetic polymorphism and divergence at functional and nonfunctional sites to estimate the rate of adaptive evolution of each gene in the genome. To this end, I will use a method, which I recently applied to estimate the amount of adaptive evolution driven by virus interaction (Castellano, Uricchio et al. 2019). I will then subject the network of known protein interactions from the KEGG, REACTOME, and SPRING gene network databases to a network propagation algorithm. This approach will allow me to test if recurrently adapting autosomal genes are more strongly connected to candidate meiotic drivers than expected (when properly accounting for network architecture and tissue expression).\n\n\nMeta-analyses\nGoal: accumulate and contrast evidence across species to produce new insight. In contrast to the complex computational analyzes of each species, the results produced are simple. The inference of selective sweeps will produce genomic regions containing a small number of candidate genes. Inference of hybrid incompatibility will produce genomic regions where admixture between populations is precluded by reduced fitness (admixture deserts). Although each genomic region is associated with a measure of significance and analysis meta-information, the size of meta datasets will be small enough to handle in Jupyter notebooks hosted from a powerful HPC compute node. This allows for manual inspection, visualization, and data analysis of the continually accumulating results.\nI will use a published statistical method for cross-species gene set analysis (XGSA) to identify pathways and regulatory networks with an overrepresentation of candidate genes. By testing all candidate genes for enrichment of ontologies terms, I will further establish which cellular functions are primarily responsible for hybrid incompatibility. I will combine these analyses with inferred species divergence, admixture, and demography, as well as the ecological, physical, and behavioral properties of each species. That way, I will learn if the responsible genes, pathways, or characteristic cellular functions differ in species with XY and ZW sex-determination system, or if they differ at early and late stages of speciation. I will also learn if meiotic drive is more frequent, and speciation rate faster, in species with no sperm competition. This is expected because detrimental effects on fertility have a smaller effect on fitness in such species.\n\n\nProject feasibility\nThe progress and completion of this project rely on access to an HPC facility, which is available through the Bioinformatics Research Centre (GenomeDK). All data is either publicly available or available through collaborators. The feasibility of the proposed methods has been ensured through pilot projects of my MSc and project students. It is possible that one or more of my hypotheses are not proven true. However, the bulk of empirical evidence leaves it unquestionable that sex-chromosomes hold the key to understanding speciation. Hence even in the unlikely case that my hypotheses are wrong, the scale and breadth of this project will reveal the true mechanisms. In either case, the general interest in these questions will ensure publications of high impact.\n\n\nWork and publication plan\nThe research project constitutes the work of three postdocs and two Ph.D. students. One two-year postdoc will work on new methods for the inference of selective sweeps from diversity data. One two-year postdoc will work on autosomal adaptation in response to meiotic drive. One three-year postdoc will work on hybrid incompatibility and invasion of meiotic drivers. One Ph.D. student will work on the inference of selection and admixture using incomplete lineage sorting. One Ph.D. student will work on phase-type distributions and admixture graphs. All students and postdocs will take part in workflow integration and meta-analyses. See Figure 4 for an activity plan. Students and postdocs will lead publications of their own methods or analysis work and coauthor papers on results from integrating all analyses into the broader workflow.\n\n\nRecruitment and training\nI have already identified an ideal candidate for the Ph.D. project dedicated to working on phase-type distributions. Tobias Røikjer has written his master thesis on this topic and has been instrumental in executing the pilot project that forms the basis of the method proposed. I will recruit postdocs and an additional Ph.D. student internationally, using my network of past and present collaborators, particularly at Uppsala University, UC Berkeley, Harvard, Max Planck in Leipzig, and Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. Ph.D. students will be enrolled in the Graduate School of Science (GSST) and Technology at Aarhus University. Postdocs and Ph.D. students will be part of a study environment with international postdocs and Ph.D. students from other groups, all working on evolutionary questions using similar theory and methodology. In addition to the mandatory activities associated with GSST, Ph.D. students at our research center are fully integrated into all academic activities such as seminars and journal clubs. Postdocs will be encouraged to participate in my courses in population genomics and data science. Project students and MSc students will be trained in the context of this project and be assigned small self-contained subprojects addressing scientific questions embedded in the larger research strategy.\n\n\nReferences\nBachtrog, D., C.

We allow for arbitrary population growth in both species after they had a common ancestor. We focus on the case in which a single chromosome is sequenced from one of the species. We use classical diffusion theory to show that, if the ancestral species was at equilibrium under mutation and drift and a chromosome from one of the descendant species carries the derived allele, the frequency spectrum in the other species is uniform, independently of the demographic history of both species. We also predict the expected densities of segregating and fixed sites when the chromosome from the other species carries the ancestral allele. We compare the predictions of our model with the site-frequency spectra of SNPs in the four HapMap populations of humans when the nucleotide present in the Neanderthal DNA sequence is ancestral or derived, using the chimp genome as the outgroup.\n\n\n\nI guess it is a special case if the IM model: E.g., 10 from pop1 and 1 from pop2.

    "text": "PRDM9 does not turn over because hotspot motifs are subjected to meiotic drive. They do so because rare alleles quickly rise in frequency upon reticulation of separated subspecies.\nCorrelate positive selection (dn/ds) of DNA contacting residues on evolutionary branches to the likelihood they have experienced reticulation.\nSequence PRDM9 along species boundaries and compare to PRDM9 diversity far from hybridization zone.\nFind organism where some subspecies recently hybridized and some seem not to have and compare PRDM9 variation.\nUse CLUES to compare allele trajectory variants to times of reticulation.\nFst at hotspots?\nDoes PRDM9 turn over because a few very important hotspots are completely exhausted?\nHypotheses: If PRDM9 is so important and the important function that has ensured conservation of the functional domains?\nLoss of PRDM9 by aborted speciation: Two mechanisms serve to concentrate recombination in hotspots: PRDM9 and a PRDM9 independent mechanism. The first is the dominant more effective mechanism because it diverts recombination proteins form promoters. The other is required to ensure sufficient recombination in regions sensitive to at least one recombination - like the PAR. Say then, that a species is subjected to reproductive barriers creating many separate populations accumulating PRDM9 differences sufficient produce hybrid infertility among populations. If this process is then aborted by mixing all population (more quickly than mate selection can keep them apart) there will be very strong selection on variants shifting more hotspot control to a mechanism independent of PRDM9. If true, this would mean that lineages subject to more of this type of population structure events would be more less reliant on PRDM9 - in the extreme case to an extent where it may be lost. This could explain the GC patterns in dog and panda that suggests that their ancestor had fixed hotspots accumulating GC. In this ancestor both mechanisms must have been operating because dogs lost PRDM9 and kept fixed hotspots whereas panda seems to have shifted the mechanism back to PRDM9 control. This would require that some alleles are promiscuous and others not. This is not unrealistic as we know some pairs to be compatible and others not.\nChromosomal rearrangements could imply that recombination is only possible for a small part of the chromosome (like for PAR), promoting selection for PRDM9 independent control.\nIf drive is the explanation we should always either see positive selection or stationary hotspots not in promoters but with high GC – unless arrays change neutrally before then. This is testable by comparing maps for species with and without positive selection on PRDM9 residues. [e.g. salmon and zebrafish]\nCould also be that we only see drive in species where arrays are so stable that neutral evolution does not produce new alleles fast enough. (couple array stability and observed selection)\n[if there is only selection on DNA contacting residues, that means that it is not the reshuffling of the zinc-finger array that is selected by only the mutation of DNA contacting bases.]\nUnderstand what drives the adaptive evolution of PRDM9. To determine how loss and duplication of PRDM9 affects recombination patterns. How can a seemingly important gene like PRDM9 be lost? Which of the proposed effects drive the rapid evolution of the Zinc-finger motif? Is the evolution of PRDM9 coupled to population structure and emergence of new species? What triggers infertility in heterozygotes? Can PRDM9 sweep to fixation because it promotes efficiency of recombination between loci in an otherwise cold region?\nSpeaking against drive explaining strong positive selection:\n- If mutations are not rate (we have reason to believe they are frequent) then selection on new variants would start long before current allele motifs are exhausted, promoting a large number of alternative upcoming alleles and thus a larger variety that we observe (but do we observe that in chimps or bonobos?).\n- If depletions are only on the order of 10% over we would not expect it to be subject to selective events more often than other sites. Check alpha value of DNA contacting bases.\n- Only 20% of motifs are recognized by PRDM9 as hotspots. if PRDM9 can shift to binding the other 80% motifs when the 20% are depleted then we would expect onset of positive selection driving new alleles to be much delayed.\nThings to check:\nalpha value on DNA contacting bases on human vs chimp lineage.\nhttps://jaspar.genereg.net/search?q=CTCFL&collection=all&tax_group=all&tax_id=all&type=all&class=all&family=all&version=all\nJASPAR - CTCF - MA0139.1 - profile summary\nhttps://jaspar.genereg.net/matrix/MA0139.1/\nIf hotspots overlap conserved ORIs, then we should be able to find PRDM9 hotspot motifs on internal branches.

    "text": "Our goal is to understand better how selection and recombination together drive evolution. How do these forces shape individual species? How do they contribute to the formation of new species? We address these questions through three complementing lines of research. We develop methods to identify selective sweeps from large sets of full genomes. We also use incomplete lineage sorting to identify selective sweeps in ancestral species. Our primary focus is on humans and primates. We use these methods to identify forces that drive recurrent selection on large sets of genes. A gene variant may contribute to the fitness of the organism. As a result, more offspring will carry these variants, and over time, they will rise in frequency. Yet, higher organism fitness is only a vehicle of this process; it is not required. Selection favors any variant that promotes its own transmission to the next generation. This is true even for variants that reduce organism fitness. Such selfish genes are often found on the non-recombining parts of the X and Y sex chromosomes. Sperm cells carry either an X or a Y chromosome. If a gene on these chromosomes can affect the proportion of X and Y carrying sperm, it affects its own selection. I can do this by distorting the symmetry of meiosis. It can also do it by killing sperm carrying the other sex chromosome. Both mechanisms distort the sex-ratio of offspring and may harm male fertility. Never the less, natural selection will still favor the responsible genes. This is called meiotic drive. The X chromosome should be subject to recurrent strong selective sweeps. This is the case in the living great apes, as well as in their ancestors. We have recently shown this to be the case in humans too. Following the exodus from Africa, modern humans experienced strong sweeps displacing Neanderthal admixture. We continue this work to understand which population genetic mechanisms triggered these sweeps. We still do not know which specific genes act as drivers, and by which mechanism they act. Adaptive selection will promote genes that compensate for the detrimental effects of meiotic drive. Such genes are likely many and part of the same pathways as the meiotic drivers. Recurrent adaptation may thus be characteristic of pathways affected by drivers. Preliminary results suggest that such pathways include DNA damage response, recombination, and apoptosis. Hybrid incompatibility and species formation. Genetic incompatibilities between incipient species usually first affect the heterogametic sex. E.g. X/Y humans males and Z/W female birds. We, and others, believe that meiotic drive may explain this century-old observation. Each meiotic driver distorts the sex-ratio in favor of one sex-chromosome. This may lead to an arms race between the two chromosomes, accelerating their evolution. As subspecies diverge, sex chromosomes will thus likely show the first hybrid incompatibilities. X and Y chromosomes from separate subspecies become incompatible. This results in dysfunctional spermatogenesis and infertility in X/Y hybrid males. [Figure with tree X/Y divergence]. Study hybridization zones and admixed individuals to identify barriers to admixture on different time scales. Adaptive introgression may be a sign that the region is subject to drive and will eventually contribute to incompatibility.\nResearch strategy\nWrite/prepare a professional presentation of myself\nSkriv kort genetisk beskrivelse af min forskning til MBGs hjemmeside, så jeg ikke behøver at opdatere den hele tiden.\nThink about how to make use of all the new baboon sequences (do it myself?)

There would be strong selection to resolve this by evolving separate (possibly sex-antagonistic) functions or expressions for the translocated genes.

I hypothesize that meiotic drivers, in addition to other detrimental effects, fuel an inactivation-dosage-conflict between the sexes: If genes that escape MSCI in males also escape XCI in females, the deleterious excess female dosage must be resolved by lower gene expression, in turn leading to dosage deficiency in males (Figure below).

It will change along the way, but with a plan, you will know when it does.\nYou should outline the project plan and what you intend to do in the weeks/months of your project. Such a plan is tentative and will change along the way when you find such changes are meaningful or necessary.\nAn excellent way to do this is to use the GitHub Project feature on our group GitHub account.\n\n\n\n\nNielsen, Rasmgb, and Montgomery Slatkin. 2016.
